# Bayesian-Network
A medical clinic is trying to determine the probability that a patient has a certain disease. The test which is used to diagnose the disease is not always accurate. The clinic knows that the probability of a false positive is 1%, and the probability of a false negative is 5%. The clinic has a patient who has tested positive for the disease.
