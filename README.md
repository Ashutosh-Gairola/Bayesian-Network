# Bayesian-Network
A medical clinic is trying to determine the probability that a patient has a certain disease. The test which is used to diagnose the disease is not always accurate. The clinic knows that the probability of a false positive is 1%, and the probability of a false negative is 5%. The clinic has a patient who has tested positive for the disease.


Knowing that disease occurs in a patient 25% times. They want to use Bayesian Theorem to calculate the probability that the patient actually has the disease. The Bayesian network will consist of two nodes: 'D' (for disease) and 'T' (for test result). conditional probability distributions (CPDs) for the nodes will be based on the provided information
